## [1.0.1] â€“ 2025-10-04
### Fixed
- Fixed hook registration to use fully qualified class name with namespace: `MediaWiki\\Extension\\ParagraphLinks\\ParagraphLinksHooks::onBeforePageDisplay`
- Fixed ResourceLoader module registration by changing `"packageFiles"` to `"scripts"` in extension.json for proper auto-loading
- Fixed anchor ID detection to use existing MediaWiki-generated `<span id="">` elements instead of generating new IDs from heading text
- Fixed CSS positioning to prevent heading text from shifting when icons appear (changed to absolute positioning)
- Added missing `use MediaWiki\MediaWikiServices;` import to resolve "Class not found" error

### Changed
- Icon now appears to the left of headings (left-aligned) instead of right-aligned
